LOGO SETUP:

Save the Cloud & Cards logo image you have as "logo.png" in this directory.

The logo should be:
- Named: logo.png
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Recommended size: 200x200px or larger

The logo is already referenced in index.html and will display automatically once you add the file.

If you don't have the logo file handy, the site will work fine - just add it later and refresh the page.
